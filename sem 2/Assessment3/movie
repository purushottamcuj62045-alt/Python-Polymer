'''. A movie rating system is a way of evaluating and scoring films based on various criteria, 
often to help audiences determine the quality or suitability of a movie. There are several types 
of movie rating systems in use today, ranging from simple star-based systems to more complex 
scoring methods. As a python developer You need to build a simple system that stores movie 
ratings (Star Rating System (1–5 stars)). Each movie's title will be the key, and its rating 
will be the value (Star Rating System (1–5 stars)). Following are the requirements of the 
system given below: 
Requirements: 
• Store Movie Ratings: Create a dictionary where the key is the movie title, and the 
value is the movie's rating (Star Rating System (1–5 stars)). 
o Example: {'Inception': 9, 'Avatar': 8, 'Titanic': 7} 
• Add a New Movie: Write a function to add a new movie with its title and rating. 
• Update Movie Rating: Implement a function that allows the user to update the rating 
of a movie. 
• Delete a Movie: Write a function to delete a movie from the system. 
• Find the Highest Rated Movie: Write a function to find the highest-rated movie. 
• Average Rating: Implement a function to calculate the average rating of all movies. '''
