Q1. A Product Price Management System (PPMS) is a software tool or platform 
used by businesses to efficiently manage the pricing of products across 
different sales channels, regions, and over time. This system helps businesses 
to optimize their pricing strategies, track price changes, and ensure
 consistency in pricing across various platforms. You need to create a system 
 to manage product (Horticulture related) prices in a store. Each product will 
 have a name as the key and the price as the value in a dictionary. 
 The product management system have functionalities given below:

Requirements:

•	Store Products: Create a dictionary to store product (Horticulture related) names as keys and their prices as values. Store approximately 20 records.
o	Example: {'Apple': 1.5, 'Banana': 0.9, 'walnut': 1.2}
•	Add a New Product: Implement a function to add a new product and its price to the dictionary.
•	Update Product Price: Implement a function to update the price of an existing product.
•	Delete a Product: Implement a function that removes a product from the dictionary.
•	Calculate Total Price: Write a function that calculates the total price of all products in the dictionary.
•	Discount on All Products: Write a function to apply a percentage discount to all products and print the updated prices.
